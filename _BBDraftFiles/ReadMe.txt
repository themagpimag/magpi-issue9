This folder contains a basic 32 page scribus file to generate the barebones draft pdfs.

This will allow a full 32 draft to be posted where each page can be replaced and reordered as we develop the mag (with gaps to encorage people to work on the missing parts).

The PDF files at this stage will be named as follows (Topic aids with sorting article order):
PageXX-BB-Topic.pdf

When articles are used to replace these files the format should be (1 page per pdf):
PageXX.pdf
PageXX-pub.pdf
